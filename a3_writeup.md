# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
the function takes in a soource list and searches for a match between the given pattern and the source, if the result of that search is none it returns "I don't Understand" if there is a match found but no availible answer, it returns "No answer" and if there is a match and answer it returns said answer in the form of a list.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added the dark knight, it was made in 2008, I just really like the movie.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
I added a new way to find actors by the title("who was in _")since I feel like this is how most people would ask this question casually into a search engine or even just talking to someone. 

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I would create a chabot that is specified to a particular subject the same way this one was constructed, an example of this would be a chatbot that advises on nutrition and foods, like answering facts and objective statements about the nutritional facts of diffrent foods.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
The most difficult portion of this assignment was finding out how some of the new concepts in python work like pattern-action lists or statements like : return ans if ans else["no answers"], so just navigating around new things.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
yes i did and it worked with the movie I added
